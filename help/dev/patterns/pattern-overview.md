# Implementation patterns overview

The [!DNL Adobe Target] implementation patterns provide guidance on how to implement [!DNL Target] following best practices and to help reduce implementation issues for customers and consultants.

Because the the process of implementing [!DNL Target] varies with different frameworks and platforms, the [!DNL Target] team plans to create implementation patterns for various frameworks, platforms, and integrations. 

The following pattern is currently available:

* [[!DNL Recommendations] implementation pattern using at.js](/help/dev/patterns/recs-atjs/recs-implementation-pattern-atjs.md)

These implementation patterns are intended to focus on what to do, when to do it, and where to do it rather than how to do it. Detailed flow diagrams help you understand the sequence of operations and links to relevant documentation provide contextual and step-by-step instructions.
