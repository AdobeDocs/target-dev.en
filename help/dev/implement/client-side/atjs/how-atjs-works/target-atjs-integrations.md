Supports at.js with [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.2 with FP-11577 (or later). For more information, see [Integrating with [!DNL Adobe Target]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/previous-updates/aem-previous-versions.html) and select your AEM version.|

AEM brings together all of your content and assets in a central location to fuel your personalization strategy.

## Unsupported Integrations

| Integration | Details |
|--- |--- |
|Legacy [!DNL Target] to [!DNL SiteCatalyst] Integration|This was the integration that sent campaign and recipe ids to [!DNL SiteCatalyst] via the page call so you could do reporting in the [!DNL SiteCatalyst] UI. This functionality is replaced by A4T.|
|Legacy [!DNL Target] to [!DNL SiteCatalyst] Integration|This was the integration that made mbox calls named `"SiteCatalyst: Event"` and `"SiteCatalyst: Purchase"` so you could build success metrics and user profiles based on evars and props. This functionality is replaced by A4T and P&A.|
|Legacy [!DNL Audience Manager] (AAM) to [!DNL Target] Integration|This was the integration that made a front-end API call to retrieve AAM segments and then sent them as mbox parameters on every mbox call on the page.|

## Third-Party Integrations

| Integration | Details |
|--- |--- |
|Other Tag Managers|at.js should work with non-Adobe tag management platforms, but be careful using custom integration features that other vendors have developed. Their integrations might be dependent on internal  mbox.js functions that no longer exist in  at.js.|
|Third-party data providers (e.g. Demandbase, Bluekai, weather APIs)|Many third-party data providers used to supplement Target's user profiling can be integrated using the at.js [Data Providers](../atjs-functions/targetglobalsettings.md#data-providers) feature.|
