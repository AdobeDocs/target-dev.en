# On-device decisioning rule artifact

The rule artifact is a JSON representation of your Adobe Target on-device decisioning activities. The rule artifact is generated by Target and propagated to the Akamai CDN to ensure there is a rule artifact available as close as possible to your visitors. The rule artifact contains metadata that ensures precise execution and delivery of your activities, while also allowing for real-time analytics via event tracking.
