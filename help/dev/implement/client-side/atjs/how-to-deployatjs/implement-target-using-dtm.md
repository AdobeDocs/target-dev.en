# Implement Target using Dynamic Tag Manager (DTM)

Adobe Dynamic Tag Manager is a legacy product and is no longer supported. For the best implementation experience, Adobe recommends using tags in Adobe Experience Platform.

Tags in Adobe Experience Platform are the next generation of tag management capabilities from Adobe. Tags give customers a simple way to deploy and manage the analytics, marketing, and advertising tags necessary to power relevant customer experiences.
