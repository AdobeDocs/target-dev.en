# Use [!UICONTROL Location Service]

Location is an important context for understanding and engaging with mobile users. By using this context, mobile app developers can enhance the app design and make it a more personalized and engaging experience.

[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Location Service] ([!DNL Location Service]) is a geo-location service that enables mobile apps with location awareness to understand the location context by using rich and easy-to-use SDK interfaces accompanied by a flexible database of points of interests (POIs).

You can use [!DNL Location Service] with [!DNL Target] to leverage rules with [tags in Adobe Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/home.html) to attach your [!UICONTROL Places] data to your [!DNL Adobe Target] SDK events.
