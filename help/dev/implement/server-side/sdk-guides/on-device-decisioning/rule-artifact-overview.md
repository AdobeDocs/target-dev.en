# Rule artifact overview

The rule artifact is a JSON representation of your Adobe Target on-device decisioning activities. It is generated by Adobe Target and propagated to the Akamai CDN to ensure there is a rule artifact available as close as possible to your end users. It contains metadata that ensures precise execution and delivery of your activities, while also allowing for real-time analytics via event tracking. The Adobe Target SDKs can be configured in a way that allows for automatic management of the rule artifact, by which it may be downloaded or updated according to a user-specified time interval. Furthermore, you can also maintain your own local copy of the rule artifact using a distributed memory caching system like [Memcached](https://memcached.org/) to initialize the Adobe Target SDK, so your stateless servers can serve requests immediately. To learn more about these options, reference the following guides:

* [Downloading, Storing, and Updating the Rule Artifact Automatically via the Adobe Target SDK](rule-artifact-sdk.md)
* [Downloading, Storing, and Updating the Rule Artifact via JSON Payload](rule-artifact-json.md)

```javascript
const request = {
  trace: {
    authorizationToken: '88f1a924-6bc5-4836-8560-2f9c86aeb36b'
  },
  execute: {
    mboxes: [{
      address: getAddress(req),
      name: "node-sdk-mbox"
    }]
}};
```
