## Terminology

| Term | Description |
|--- |--- |
|Classic API|APIs that are linked to your [!DNL Target Classic] account. These API calls are based on a username and password-based authentication and use the hostname `testandtarget.omniture.com`. If your API calls contain a user name and password in the request URL, you must transition to the [!DNL Adobe Developer Console] APIs.|
|[[!DNL Adobe Developer Console]](https://developer.adobe.com/console/home)|The [!DNL Adobe Developer Console] is the gateway for [!DNL Target] APIs. These APIs are connected to your [!DNL Target Standard/Premium] account. The [!DNL Target] APIs on the [!DNL Adobe Developer Console] use a [JWT-based authentication](../../before-administer/configure-authentication.md), which is the industry standard for secure enterprise APIs.|
