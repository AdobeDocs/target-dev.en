# SDKs

[!DNL Adobe Target] offers [server-side SDKs](../../implement/server-side/server-side-overview.md) to interact with the [!DNL Target Delivery API] and help ease the [!UICONTROL Target] integration with other [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] solutions such as [!UICONTROL Adobe Analytics] and [!DNL Adobe Audience Manager].

The SDKs help you to follow best practices in managing sessions and cookies. It is highly recommended to leverage an SDK to smooth away any complexities and prevent incorrect utilization of the API.
